A simple gallery of the Pog Punks nft page, as you scroll, the website queries alchemy api for more nfts. Allows users to click on each NFT for additional details, creating a 3D card that moves with the mouse. No prier experience with javascript or react, primarily on a multitude of video tutorials I found on YouTube.
